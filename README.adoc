== Introduction

Morfuse is a scripting engine library: it has its own script language. It is a script engine inspired from Ritual's ÃœberTools for Quake III and Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (it can parse scripts from the last one). This script engine targets games primarily.

== Building

=== Requirements

==== Windows

- Winflexbison (https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison)
- CMake (at least 3.13)
- A compiler that supports C++17 and has no issue with the standard (MSVC 2019 works well)

==== Linux

- Flex and Bison
- CMake (at least 3.13)
- A compiler that supports C++17 and has no issue with the standard (clang-12 is the most liked)

=== Configure and compile

==== Windows

- Download the latest version of Winflexbison from here: https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison/releases and extract it somewhere
- (Checkout morfuse and) create a *cmake* directory inside the project's directory (can be named anything) and cd into it
- Configure with CMake, assuming that you have a compiler installed/present in %PATH%:
[source,batch]
----
cmake -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE="<path to winflexbison>\win_flex.exe" -DBISON_EXECUTABLE="<path to winflexbison>\win_bison.exe" -DFLEX_INCLUDE_DIR="<path to winflexbison>\flex_bison\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\
----
- Build & install:
[source,batch]
----
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --config Release
----

==== Linux (Ubuntu)

- Install required tools (CMake, clang-12, ninja-build, flex, bison and libfl-dev for Flex):
[source]
----
apt install -y cmake make clang-12 lld-12 ninja-build flex bison libfl-dev
----
- (Checkout morfuse and) create a *cmake* directory inside the project's directory (can be named anything) and cd into it
- Configure with CMake:
[source,bash]
----
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja ..\
----
- Build and install:
[source,bash]
----
ninja
cmake --install . --config Release
----

=== Using the library externally

Since it's CMake and cross-platform, you can use it with your CMake project! Just define *morfuse_DIR* to the path of the installed library and call `find_package(morfuse)`. The include directory will be set in *morfuse_INCLUDE_DIR*

=== Example code

[source,cpp]
----
#include <morfuse/Script/Context.h>
#include <morfuse/Common/membuf.h>

#include <iostream>

const char sampleScript[] =
"main:\n"
"local.string = \"Hello, world!\"\n"
"println local.string\n"
"end";

int main()
{
	// This example only cover the execution of script

	mfuse::ScriptContext context;
	// Set the stream to use for 'Output'.
	// The script above will call println which will use the 'Output' level
	context.GetOutputInfo().SetOutputStream(mfuse::outputLevel_e::Output, &std::cout);

	mfuse::ScriptMaster& director = context.GetDirector();

	// Instantiate a memory buffer stream (implementation of std::istream)
	// It will be used to read and parse the script from a memory buffer.
	mfuse::imemstream membuf(sampleScript, sizeof(sampleScript));

	// This will parse and compile the script into a program buffer (opcodes) that the interpreter will execute
	// The parser will read the script using the buffer above
	const mfuse::ProgramScript* const script = director.GetProgramScript("example", membuf);

	// This will create a thread that will execute the ProgramScript instance above
	// labels define the position at which threads will start
	// If no label is specified (second parameter), the thread starts at position 0 by default
	//
	// If the thread has finished executing, then this method will return null, otherwise, in the case of a wait, it will return an object of the thread
	director.ExecuteThread(script);

	// Output:
	// Hello, world!
	//

	return 0;
}

There is no real documentation yet but it would be nice to have one. Feel free to contribute if you're interested in this script engine!

== General features

Those are obvious but still worth mentioning:

* Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, x86, x64, ARM, PowerPC, etc...)
* Ability to create classes and methods to be used by scripts
* Pausable/Resumable threads
* Dynamic variables
* Script can be executed with parameters through C++ code, C++ code can easily retrieve return values from thread
* Target list, something like `$entity_name.some_var = 1`
